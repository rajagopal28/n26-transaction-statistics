## 2018 Attempt: FAIL
*Pros:*
- Plenty of tests

*Cons:*
- Too many layers of synchronization, synchronized keyword is used on multiple layers which is incorrect and not optimal
- Hard-to-understand exception handling (using single complex exception instead of multiple exception with meaningful names) .

## 2019 Attempt: FAIL
*Some of the feedback given were:*

*PROS:*
- good test coverage
- good separation of concerns

*CONS:*
- did not meet the requirements (O(n) solution, does not clean up, not thread-safe everywhere)
